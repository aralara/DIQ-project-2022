# DIQ-project-2022
<b>Project of Data and Information Quality 2022-2023 course at Politecnico di Milano</b>

 The objective was to take two dirty datasets [<i>Adult</i>, <i>Frogs</i>] with different accuracy (50% - 90%) and evaluate the classification of the tuples with machine learing techniques before and after outlier detection.
 This evaluation was made with two different outlier detection techniques: standard with <i>Z-score</i> and advanced <i>KNN</i>. Then, the datasets were evaluated with <i>RidgeClassifier</i>
 and <i>DecisionTreeClassifier</i> to verify accuracy<br>
 
 * The folder contains the dirty datasets and code used to perform the cleaning activities
 * The report explains the pipeline of the implementation and the obtained results<br>
 
 Final grade: 3/3
